# Tech Radar for Delegate

Welcome to the **Tech Radar** project for **Delegate**, https://tech.delegate.cloud! This project helps us track and assess technologies, frameworks, and tools that are relevant to our organization. Inspired by the [Zalando Tech Radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar/tree/master), this radar visualizes technology decisions to help guide our engineering and business teams. It currently organizes technologies into four categories, which are programming/scripting languages, frameworks, tooling, and cloud services.

## Purpose

The goal of the Tech Radar is to provide a snapshot of technologies our organization is exploring, adopting, or retiring. 

## How It Works

The Tech Radar categorizes technologies into quadrants and assigns them to stages based on their maturity and adoption within our organization:
- **Quadrants** represent different categories of technology (e.g., Infrastructure, Frameworks, Tooling, Cloud Services).
- **Stages** reflect the technology's current status:
  - **Adopt**: We are actively using this technology and recommend it.
  - **Trial**: We encourage testing this technology in limited scope.
  - **Assess**: We are exploring this technology but have not yet committed.
  - **Hold**: We discourage usage and may retire this technology soon.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from across the organization to keep the Tech Radar updated and relevant! To suggest new technologies or request changes:

1. **Submit a new technology**: Use the [feature request template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) to propose a new technology or change an existing one.
2. **Report a Bug**: Use the [bug report template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to report issues with the radar or project.
